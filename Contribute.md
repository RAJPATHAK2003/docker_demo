## How to Start the Project Manually

Follow these steps to run the project manually on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. For example, if using Node.js:

    ```
    Or for Python:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env to set your configuration
    ```

4. **Run the Application**
    Start the application using the appropriate command:
    - For Node.js:
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```
    - For Python:
      ```bash
      python app.py
      ```

**Note:** Adjust the commands above according to your project's language and framework.

## Install Docker and Docker Compose

Before running the project with Docker, ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.

### **Install Docker**

Follow the official Docker installation guide for your operating system:  
[Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

For example, on Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
```

On macOS (using Homebrew):
```bash
brew install --cask docker
```

### **Install Docker Compose**

Docker Desktop includes Docker Compose by default.  
If you need to install it separately, follow the instructions here:  
[Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

For example, on Linux:
```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```
